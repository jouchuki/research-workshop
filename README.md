My code for the Research Workshop Speech Emotion Recognition with Ravdess
This is my code for different deep learning models that were made by me and a paper that was made by our group. Our research paper contains a detailed
overview of how these models were built and how we approached the project. This is my first major undertaking in the sphere of deep machine learning.
